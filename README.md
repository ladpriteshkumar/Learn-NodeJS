# What is Node.js?
Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime environment, built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine. Node.js is open-source and cross platform, widely used by thousands of developers around the world to develop I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites, single-page applications, and other web applications.

Contrary to a perception, Node.js is not a programming language like Python, Java or C/C++. Node.js is a runtime, similar to Java virtual machine, that converts JavaScript code into machine code.

With Node.js, it is possible to use JavaScript as a backend. With JavaScript already being a popular choice for frontend development, application development around MERN (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js.) and MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js) stacks is being increasingly employed by developers.


# Why Learn Node.js?
Node.js is used for server-side programming with JavaScript. Hence, you can use a single programming language (JavaScript) for both front-end and back-end development.

Node.js implements asynchronous execution of tasks in a single thread with async and await technique. This makes aNode.js application significantly faster than multi-threaded applications.

Node.js is being used to build command line applications, web applications, real-time chat applications, REST APIs etc.
